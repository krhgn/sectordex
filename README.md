# Sectordex
A program I made to quickly find desirable colony locations in a Starsector save. You can use a wide range of criteria to search for any system you like.

## Quick setup for running the code
- Install Python 3.9
- open command prompt
- use `pip` (comes with Python) to install the required modules by running these commands:
```
pip install lxml
pip install PySimpleGUI
pip install numpy
pip install commentjson
```
- run `sectordex_app.py`
- at this point stuff should hopefully work
